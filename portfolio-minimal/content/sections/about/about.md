Hey there! I'm Georges, and I'm glad you're here. I recently graduated with a degree in Software Engineering from the University of Ottawa. Currently, I work as a **Software Developer @ Ericsson**, focusing on Cloud RAN Micro-services. On the side, I also volunteer as a **Software Developer @ [Software For Love!](https://www.softwareforlove.com/)** For more of my work experience, check out my resume.

I'm passionate about **fullstack and backend development**. My main experience lies in .NET and TypeScript, but I love exploring different frameworks and languages through side projects. I have a genuine curiosity for understanding how things work and why they work.

At the moment, I'm diving into the fascinating world of distributed systems. This interest was sparked by my work at Ericsson, where I get to learn about creating complex, scalable software solutions.

Beyond the world of tech, I have a deep, deep love for music (as you can probably tell by some of my projects below). I also enjoy dabbling in music production from time to time. Additionally, I've been actively involved in the Lebanese Culture Club at uOttawa for the past three years, where we organize social events and galas to celebrate Lebanese culture.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects, experiences, and the unique combination of skills and passions that drive me. Thank you for stopping by, and I'm excited to connect with you soon!
